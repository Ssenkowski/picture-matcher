----------------------------- Client Side Frontend --------------------------------

- Use React.js 'fetch' requests and retrieve pictures from https://pixabay.com/api/docs/, https://imgur.com -  the pug ones were funny. Weiner dogs.  Food? Buildings? Clipart might be some of the best options for simple images.

- Create home page with usernames displayed to select and Menu options.

- Create an options page to adjust background image selections (random or choosen), loading image selections (random or chosen), sound (On or Off), AutoUpload to online scoreboard (Yes/No?)...

- Create a start button to begin the game

- Once the options are picked direct users to their Gameboard.

- Load gameboard background image (random, selected.  Maybe earn new backgrounds as you get more points?) and gameboard             pictures with placeholder image 'card' backside.

-Loading image ideas - weiner dog skateboarding :D - jokes - 

- Fade gameboard to the background and load start button - "Ready :) ?"

- Test gameboard initialization a design page to pull images for matching from outside url and internal urls saved to           activerecord

- Assign pictures to set locations.  Each picture needs a duplicate on the board at the same time.
